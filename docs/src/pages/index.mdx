# React Native Awesome Slider

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <img src="/assets/slider.gif" width="300" />
</div>

A powerful React Native Slider component powered by Reanimated v2 and react-native-gesture-handler.

## Why this library?

- Pure javascript slider implementations usually rely on `react-native`'s gesture events which may inadvertently trigger 'swipe to go back' events as you pan the slider. ❌
- Native sliders rely on state updates, which can cause performance issues. ❌
- This library uses Reanimated's ShareValue to run code directly in the UIThread for better performance, and react-native-gesture-handler won't interfere with your swiping gestures. ✨

## Features

- 100% written in TypeScript
- Built upon react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler
- Supports Tap & Pan triggering
- Support for discrete slider
- Support haptic feedback
- and more...
